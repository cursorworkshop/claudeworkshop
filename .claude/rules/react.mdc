# React Development Rules

## Component Structure

Use functional components with hooks, keep components small and focused, extract reusable logic into custom hooks, and use proper prop drilling or context as needed.

## State Management

Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), keep state as local as possible, use proper dependency arrays in useEffect, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

## Performance

Use React.memo for expensive components, implement proper key props for lists, use useCallback and useMemo when appropriate, and optimize images with Next.js Image component.

## Code Organization

Follow this organized component structure:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Organized component structure
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';
import { useCustomHook } from './hooks';

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const { data, loading } = useCustomHook();
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  return (
    <div className="container">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

## Best Practices

Use proper event handling, implement proper form handling, use proper refs when needed, implement proper error boundaries, and use proper context for global state.
