## What's New in Claude Code

Released January 22, 2026, Claude Code focuses on agent infrastructure. The three major additions:

1. **Subagents** — Independent agents that handle discrete subtasks in parallel
2. **Skills** — Reusable domain knowledge defined in `SKILL.md` files
3. **Image generation** — Create mockups and diagrams directly in the editor

## Subagents: Parallel Specialized Execution

Subagents are child agents that run independently of your main conversation. Each gets its own context window, tool access, and can use a different model.

Claude Code includes default subagents for:

- Researching your codebase
- Running terminal commands
- Executing parallel work streams

You can also define custom subagents for your team's specific needs.

**How This Fits Our Methodology**

In our 7-step process, subagents expand what you can **delegate**:

| Step  | Before 2.4                  | With Subagents                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plan  | AI reads specs, you analyze | Subagent maps dependencies while you focus on priorities |
| Build | Sequential code generation  | Parallel generation across files                         |
| Test  | One test file at a time     | Multiple test suites simultaneously                      |

The key shift: you're now delegating coordination, not just individual tasks.

## Skills: Encoding Team Knowledge

Skills are defined in `SKILL.md` files. Unlike rules (which are always-on), skills are invoked when relevant.

Use skills for:

- Team-specific patterns ("how we build API routes")
- Complex workflows ("our deployment process")
- Domain knowledge ("our data model conventions")

**Example: API Route Skill**

```markdown
# API Route Skill

When creating API routes in this project:

1. Use the handler pattern from `src/lib/api-handler.ts`
2. Add Zod validation with schemas from `src/types/`
3. Include rate limiting via the `withRateLimit` wrapper
4. Log to our standard format
```

The agent discovers and applies this when you ask it to create an API route.

## Image Generation

Generate images directly from agent conversations. Useful for:

- UI mockups during planning
- Architecture diagrams
- Quick visual assets

Images save to `assets/` by default.

## Claude Blame (Enterprise)

Claude Blame adds AI attribution to git blame. For each line, you can see:

- Whether it came from Tab, Agent, or human
- Which model generated it
- A link to the conversation that produced it

This matters for code review. When reviewing AI-generated code, you want the **context** of why it was written that way.

## Practical Application

**What to Delegate Now**

With 2.4, you can confidently delegate:

- Multi-file scaffolding (subagents handle coordination)
- Pattern-following tasks (skills encode your patterns)
- Initial test coverage (parallel test generation)

**What Still Needs Human Review**

- Architecture decisions (subagents execute, they don't decide)
- Security-critical code (AI doesn't understand your threat model)
- Business logic (domain knowledge beyond your skills files)

**What Humans Own**

- Strategic direction
- Final approval
- Production decisions

This hasn't changed. The tools are better, but the judgment stays with you.
