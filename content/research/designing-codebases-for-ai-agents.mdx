# Designing Codebases for AI Agents

Peter Steinberger dropped a post this week that hit different. He doesn't design codebases for himself anymore. He engineers them so AI agents can work efficiently.

This is a subtle but important mindset shift. Most developers still think about code organization in terms of human comprehension. Steinberger thinks about agent comprehension first.

## The Core Principle

The more you build for how the model thinks, the less you waste on prompts and corrections.

This means:

- **Obvious folder structures**: If an agent needs to find your API routes, they should be in `/api` or `/routes`, not scattered across the codebase
- **Predictable documentation locations**: README files in expected places, API docs where they should be
- **Consistent naming conventions**: When patterns are predictable, agents infer correctly more often
- **Minimal implicit knowledge**: Agents don't know your team's unwritten rules

## The Blast Radius Concept

Steinberger evaluates every change by its "blast radius"—how many files will be touched, and how long should it take?

This mental model enables a key insight: **throw many small bombs at the codebase, not large ones**.

Benefits:

- Isolated commits that are easy to review
- Simple rollbacks when something goes wrong
- Parallel agent work without merge conflicts
- Clear attribution of what changed and why

When you ask an agent to refactor an entire feature, you get a massive PR that's impossible to review properly. When you ask for small, atomic changes, you get clean commits you can actually verify.

## Parallel Agent Execution

Steinberger runs 3-8 agents in parallel in a 3x3 terminal grid. He uses the `codex` CLI as his daily driver, often with multiple agents working in the same folder.

This works because:

- Each agent handles atomic, isolated changes
- Git handles merging automatically
- Blast radius thinking prevents conflicts
- Agents make atomic commits as they work

For a ~300k LOC TypeScript React codebase, this approach means AI agents write approximately 100% of his code. The human role shifts from writing to directing and reviewing.

## Practical Implementation

**1. Restructure for Discoverability**

Before:

```
src/
  utils/
    helper.ts
    other-helper.ts
  components/
    Button/
      index.tsx
```

After:

```
src/
  features/
    auth/
      components/
      hooks/
      api/
      README.md
    dashboard/
      components/
      hooks/
      api/
      README.md
```

Features are self-contained. An agent working on auth doesn't need to understand dashboard. Context stays focused.

**2. Document for Agents**

Add `AGENT.md` or `CLAUDE.md` files that explain:

- Project conventions
- How to run tests
- Where to find what
- Common patterns used

Steinberger maintains the `agent-rules` repository (5.5k stars on GitHub) with templates for these files.

**3. Make Implicit Knowledge Explicit**

Your team knows that "the user service is weird because of legacy reasons." Agents don't. Document the quirks:

```markdown
## Known Issues

- UserService uses deprecated auth patterns (ticket #1234 tracks migration)
- Profile endpoints require double-encoding for special characters
- Tests require TEST_DB_URL env var
```

## How This Relates to Delegate, Review, Own

This approach maps directly to our methodology:

**Delegate**: With a well-structured codebase, you can delegate more confidently. Agents make fewer mistakes when the structure guides them correctly.

**Review**: Atomic commits with small blast radii are reviewable. You can actually verify what changed rather than scrolling through 50 files.

**Own**: You own the structure itself. The architecture decisions, the organization patterns, the conventions—these remain human responsibilities.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

Investing time in codebase structure for agents feels like extra work. But it's actually the highest-leverage improvement you can make.

Every hour spent making your codebase agent-friendly saves dozens of hours in prompt engineering, failed attempts, and manual fixes. It's not overhead—it's infrastructure.
