# Job vs Gym: Which Skills Should You Protect from AI?

Something we read this week that stuck.

Daniel Miessler frames AI help as Job vs Gym. At work, let the robot lift heavy things. The goal is moving them, not lifting. But at the gym? Lifting is the point. You don't outsource that.

For anyone using Claude Code daily: which skills do you want to keep sharp?

## The Framework

**Job tasks**: Work where you only care about the output. Move the boxes, write the report, ship the feature. The method matters less than the result. AI assistance makes sense here because efficiency is the goal.

**Gym tasks**: Work where the process is the point. You're building a capability, not just producing output. Outsourcing this defeats the purpose because you're trying to grow, not just deliver.

The challenge: everything _looks_ like a Job task when you're busy. Deadlines push us toward efficiency. But some "job" tasks are actually gym tasks in disguise.

## Skills Worth Protecting

For developers, gym tasks include:

**Problem Solving**

The ability to break down ambiguous requirements into concrete steps. When AI writes your implementation plans, you stop exercising this muscle.

This doesn't mean AI can't help. But there's a difference between:

- "AI, implement this feature" (job mode)
- "Let me think through the approach, then use AI to execute" (gym mode)

**Debugging**

Reading stack traces, forming hypotheses, systematically eliminating possibilities. If you always paste errors into Claude Code and accept the fix, you lose the diagnostic intuition that makes you effective when AI suggestions don't work.

**System Design**

Understanding how components fit together, making tradeoff decisions, seeing second-order effects. AI can propose architectures, but evaluating them requires judgment built from experience.

**Code Reading**

Understanding unfamiliar codebases quickly. If AI always summarizes code for you, you may lose the pattern recognition that lets you navigate legacy systems.

## The Tutoring Approach

Miessler suggests an alternative to strict separation: build a tutoring system.

When AI does gym work for you, schedule time to review what it did and why. His approach:

1. Weekly sessions where his AI assistant reviews gym work it performed
2. The AI interrogates him on methodology and reasoning
3. He must explain the work as if he did it himself

This transforms AI from a replacement into an educational tool. The work gets done _and_ you learn from it.

For developers, this might look like:

- AI writes the solution, but you walk through it line by line before committing
- AI suggests an architecture, but you diagram why it works
- AI debugs an issue, but you understand the root cause before accepting the fix

## Practical Application for Claude Code Users

**Identify Your Gym Tasks**

Make a list of capabilities you want to maintain or develop:

- Algorithmic thinking
- Database query optimization
- Frontend state management
- API design
- Testing strategy

**Track When AI Does Gym Work**

Notice when you're delegating gym tasks. Not to feel guilty—just to be aware. Common patterns:

- Accepting AI debugging fixes without understanding them
- Using AI-generated system designs without evaluation
- Letting AI structure your thinking rather than structuring it yourself

**Protect or Tutor**

For each gym task, decide:

- **Protect**: Do it yourself, AI-free
- **Tutor**: Let AI help, but study the output until you understand it deeply

Neither is wrong. The mistake is delegating gym tasks without awareness.

## How This Relates to Delegate, Review, Own

Our methodology aligns naturally with Job vs Gym:

**Delegate (Job)**: Boilerplate, standard implementations, well-defined tasks. Let AI handle these freely.

**Review (Tutor)**: Understand what AI produces. This is where tutoring happens. Review isn't just quality control—it's learning.

**Own (Gym)**: Architecture, strategic decisions, novel problem-solving. These are gym tasks. Do them yourself, or if AI helps, deeply understand the output.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

It's easier to delegate everything. AI makes the job-mode seductive because shipping feels good. But every capability you stop exercising atrophies.

The developers who thrive in the AI era won't be those who delegate most effectively. They'll be those who know exactly which muscles to keep strong.
